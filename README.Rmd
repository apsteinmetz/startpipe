# pipestarter

The goal of pipestarter is to provide an RStudio add-in for converting a variable name to an assignment string.  The project framework was cloned from Ben Marwick's "snakecaser" <https://github.com/benmarwick/snakecaser>


## Examples

Start a line with:

my_varname

if the cursor in the RStudio editor is at the end of the variable name this is what the addin will change it to:

my_varname <- my_varname %>%

That's it!


## Installation

This add-in can be installed with:

```{r eval=FALSE}
devtools::install_github("apsteinmetz/startpipe")
```
